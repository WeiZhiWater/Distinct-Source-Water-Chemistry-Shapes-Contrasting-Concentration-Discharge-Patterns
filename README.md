# Distinct-Source-Water-Chemistry-Shapes-Contrasting-Concentration-Discharge-Patterns


- Contrasting concentration‐discharge (C‐Q) relationships have been observed widely, yet a mechanistic framework that can interpret diverse patterns remains elusive. 
- This work hypothesizes that seemingly disparate C‐Q patterns are driven by switching dominance of end‐member source waters and their chemical contrasts arising from subsurface biogeochemical heterogeneity. 
- We use data from [Coal Creek](https://www.coalcreek.org/), a high‐elevation mountainous catchment in Colorado, and a tributary of the [East River](https://watershed.lbl.gov/), and a recently developed watershed reactive transport model ([BioRT‐Flux‐PIHM](https://github.com/PSUmodeling/BioRT-Flux-PIHM)). Sensitivity analysis and Monte‐Carlo simulations (500 cases) show that reaction kinetics and thermodynamics and distribution of source materials across depths govern the chemistry gradients of shallow soil water and deeper groundwater entering the stream. 
- A general equation regulates the power law slopes (b) of C‐Q patterns. The equation quantitatively interprets b values of 11 solutes (dissolved organic carbon, dissolved P, NO3−, K, Si, Ca, Mg, Na, Al, Mn, and Fe) from three catchments ([Coal Creek](https://www.coalcreek.org/), [Shale Hills](https://czo-archive.criticalzone.org/shale-hills/), and [Plynlimon](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/our-science/monitoring-site/plynlimon-critical-zone-observatory)) of differing climate, geologic, and land cover conditions.
